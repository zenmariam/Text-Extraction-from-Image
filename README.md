# Text-Extraction-from-Image
 Text extraction from sample image using tesseract and openCV

 In this project we will use tesseract to extract text from a sample image. After extracting the text we will apply some basic functions of openCV to enhance it and to get more accurate results.

 This project aims to understand the basic functions of openCV like: removing noise from the image using blur function, perform threshold transformation on the sample image, using erode function on the sample image, segregating characters by drawing a pattern around them, and more.
